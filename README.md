- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to make sure my code is functional and secure is by testing it thoroughly and consistently. I focus on writing unit tests that cover both the expected inputs and the edge cases that could break the program. I also pay close attention to validation rules, like checking that IDs are not null and that values stay within the required limits. This helps prevent bugs and keeps the program from accepting bad data. On top of that, keeping the code clean and well-organized makes it easier to find and fix issues if they come up.


- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I always start by thinking about what the user is really trying to do. Understanding the requirements is important, but I also try to picture how someone might actually interact with the program. People make mistakes, so I try to plan for those moments too, which means means writing code that handles errors clearly and makes sure the user knows what went wrong if something does not work.



- How do I approach designing software?

I focus on breaking the project down into small, manageable pieces instead of trying to handle everything at once. I make sure each class and method has a clear purpose and avoid letting any one part of the code get too complicated. I also plan ahead by thinking about how the different pieces will connect and how the logic should flow from one part to the next. This helps me stay organized and makes the code easier to test and maintain.
